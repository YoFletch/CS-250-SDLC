To interpret the user needs, Iâ€™d start by engaging with stakeholders, including end-users, product owners, and business analysts, to gather and prioritize the requirements.

When approaching the development of programs using Agile methodology, there are several key principles and processes to keep in mind. The Agile methodology places a strong emphasis on collaboration, adaptability, and iterative development. Incorporating these Agile processes into the development work will help to build software that is more responsive to user needs, adaptable to change, and of higher quality. Adaptation to change would be an Agile method of high importance.
